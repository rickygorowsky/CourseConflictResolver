Sections vs. Priority Sections

A section is an offering of a course.
A priority section is a mandatory meeting time for everyone enrolled in the course.

Example: Physics class 
priority section:   10:00 AM - 10:50 AM MoWeFr    
           section 1:   11:00 AM - 12:45 PM Mo
           section 2:   12:00 PM - 1:45 PM  Th
           section 3:   3:00 PM  - 4:45 PM  We

A student registering for physics can choose to be in section 1, 2, or 3, but
the student must come to the priority section.

A priority section can't be used without at least one section.  If a course 
contains a priority section without a section, this program will treat the course
as if it was empty.

So the student can sign up for any of the following:
priority section:   10:00 AM - 10:50 AM MoWeFr    
           section 1:   11:00 AM - 12:45 PM Mo
       
priority section:   10:00 AM - 10:50 AM MoWeFr    
           section 2:   12:00 PM - 1:45 PM  Th
       
priority section:   10:00 AM - 10:50 AM MoWeFr    
           section 3:   3:00 PM  - 4:45 PM  We
