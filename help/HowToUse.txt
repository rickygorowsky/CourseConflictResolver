How To Use Course Conflict Resolver

Course Conflict Resolver is designed to help a student find the best schedule
between course offerings.

Start by adding a course and entering its name.  To add an offering make sure 
the course is selected, then click the "Add Section" or "Add Priority Section" 
button.  The "Begin Time" and "End Time" fields are fully editable, but you 
may have to move the cursor around in them to be sure you are editing the 
minutes and not hours.  Note some fields will not be editable until a section 
or course is selected.

To calculate all possible schedules, use the checkboxs to check which courses
and sections you want to consider. The program will not examine unchecked 
offerings in its calculations. 

Each conflict-free schedule will be printed, along with a basic picture snapshot.
The picture will mark an 'X' if the offering is inside the hour even for a minute.
e.g. A course from 5:00PM - 6:00PM will have an 'X' from 5-6 and from 6-7, while
a course from 5:00PM - 5:59PM will have an 'X' from 5-6 only.

This program saves and loads files with a .schdl extension.
